Process for Writing Test Cases for Email, Journey, and Automation Testing:

Review Requirements & Specifications:

  Begin by thoroughly reviewing the campaign brief, business requirements, user stories, or requestor’s documentation.

  Identify all expected functionalities, such as CTAs, dynamic content, UTM tracking, audience segmentation, and automation triggers.

  Break Down Functional Components:

  For each email or journey element, list out specific components to be validated, including:

  Link destinations and redirects

  CTA button functionality

  Dynamic content (e.g., first names, location-based messaging)

  Fallback content for missing data

  UTM parameters in all tracked URLs

Create Test Scenarios:

  Develop high-level test scenarios to cover various use cases, including:

  Positive tests (e.g., correct data populating)

  Negative tests (e.g., behavior when data is missing or malformed)

  Cross-client rendering (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, mobile)

  Journey entry and exit criteria validation

Design Detailed Test Cases:

  Convert scenarios into granular test cases with defined steps, expected results, and test data.

  Include edge cases and validation for different subscriber segments or paths in the journey.

  Ensure test cases map directly to the requestor’s acceptance criteria.

Organize and Prioritize:

  Group test cases by journey/email component (e.g., welcome series, promo email, cart abandonment).

  Prioritize based on business impact and criticality of functionality.

Peer Review & Iteration:

  Share test cases with stakeholders or team members for review.

  Iterate based on feedback to ensure coverage and clarity.

Maintain and Reuse:

  Use naming conventions and categorize for easier reuse in regression testing or future automation.

  Store in a centralized QA tool or test management system (e.g., Jira, TestRail, Zephyr).
